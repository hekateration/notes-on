  <h3>Key learnings from Carrie</h3>
  <p class="quote">I had <span class="label">four problems with what I'd written</span>. <span class="label">First</span> and least important was the fact that the story didn't move me emotionally. <span class="label">Second</span> and slightly more important was the fact that I didn't much like the lead character. Carrie White seemed thick and passive, a ready-made victim. The other girls were ... and I just didn't care. <span class="label">Third</span> and more important still was not feeling at home with either the surroundings or my all-girl cast of supporting characters. ... <span class="label">Fourth</span> and most important of all was the realization that the story wouldn't pay off unless it was pretty long, probably even longer than ...</p>
  <p class="quote">The writer’s original perception of a character or characters may be as erroneous as the reader’s.</p>
  <p class="quote">Stopping a piece of work just because it’s hard, either emotionally or imaginatively, is a bad idea. ... Sometimes you have to go on when you don’t feel like it, and sometimes you’re doing good work when it feels like all you’re managing is to shovel shit from a sitting position.</p>

  <h3>Toolbox</h3>
  <p>Build a toolbox of your writing skills and keep refining the tools in your toolbox.</p>
  <p>Common tools go on top, the more specialized tools go on bottom. You should only have three or four levels to it.</p>
  <p>Tools included in the box:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Vocabulary</b>
      <ul>
        <li>You must have a rich, tactical vocabulary, but you shouldn’t make any efforts to improve it, or your writing will sound stilted.</li>
        <li>Use the first word that comes to mind, if it is appropriate and colorful.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Grammar</b>
      <ul>
        <li>It’s important to avoid bad grammar, so you can avoid confusing the reader. Bad grammar can lead to misunderstanding. Bad grammar produces bad sentences.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Style</b> (Elements of Style, William Strunk, E.B. White)
      <ul>
        <li>Active vs passive verbs, always better to go active:
          <br>“The meeting will be held at seven o’clock” vs “The meeting’s at seven.” <br>
          “The body was carried from the kitchen and placed on the parlor sofa” vs “Freddy and Myra carried the body out of the kitchen and laid it on the parlor sofa.”
          <br>“The writer threw the rope,” not “The rope was thrown by the writer.”</li>
        <li>Avoid adverbs if you can. Instead, replace adverbs with stronger verbs. <br>Writers typically use adverbs when they are afraid the reader won’t understand them if they don’t.</li>
        <li>The best form of dialogue attribution is said, as in he said, she said, Bill said, Monica said.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="quote">If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. There’s no way around these two things that I’m aware of, no shortcut.</p>

  <p>There should be lots of <span class="label">short paragraphs</span> and white space in an easy-to-read book. </p>
  <p class="quote">I would argue that the paragraph, not the sentence, is the basic unit of writing — the place where coherence begins and words stand a chance of becoming more than mere words.</p>

  <p>In nonfiction, writing is refined thinking.
    <br>Paragraphs should be neat and utilitarian.
    <br>Ideally, a topic followed by others which explain or amplify the first.</p>
  <p>The basic nonfiction paragraph form.
    <br>Topic-sentence-followed-by-support-and-description.
    <br>It forces the writer to organize his thoughts and creates clarity. </p>

  <p>The object of fiction is to make the reader welcome and then tell a story.
    <br>To make him forget that he is reading a story at all.</p>

  <h3>On Writing</h3>
  <p class="quote">Good writing consists of mastering the fundamentals (vocabulary, grammar, the elements of style) and then filling the third level of your toolbox with the right instruments.</p>
  <p class="quote">If you don’t have time to read, you don’t have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that.</p>
  <p class="quote">What you need to remember is that there’s a difference between lecturing about what you know and using it to enrich the story. The latter is good. The former is not.</p>

  <p>You can write about anything you want, so long as you <span class="label">tell the truth</span>.
    <br>Honesty in storytelling makes up for a great many stylistic faults.
    <br>Be honest about how your characters speak and behave.
    <br>What you know is what makes you unique.
    <br>Write what you like, then imbue it with life and make it unique by blending in your own personal knowledge of life, friendship, relationships, sex, and work. Especially work. People love to read about work.</p>
  <p class="quote">Honesty in storytelling makes up for a great many stylistic faults.</p>
  <p>Stories have 3 parts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Narration:</b> moves the story from point A to point B and finally to point Z</li>
    <li><b>Description:</b> creates sensory reality for the reader</li>
    <li><b>Dialogue:</b> brings characters to life through their speech</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="quote">Description begins in the writer’s imagination, but should finish in the reader’s.</p>
  <p class="quote">Good description depends on a few well-chosen details that stand for everything else.</p>

  <p>Remember it’s not about the setting — it’s ALWAYS about the story. That’s the most important.</p>
  <p>Similes and metaphors are fun, when they’re on target, and they help us see an old thing in a new and vivid way.</p>

  <p>Now, <span class="label">dialogue</span> gives characters voices and defines their characters.</p>
  <p class="quote">One of the cardinal rules of good fiction is never tell us a thing if you can show us, instead.</p>
  <p>Be honest and truthful about how people really act and talk — when you do that, you will probably get some criticism.</p>
  <p>Characters often grow as a story progresses. If they grow a lot, they begin to influence the course of the story instead of the other way around.</p>
  <p>Remember, in real life, everyone thinks s/he is the main character, use this attitude in your fiction to help you create 3-dimensional characters.</p>

  <p>When you write, experiment, then toss out what doesn’t work. Even if you love it. As Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch said (of <span class="label">editing</span>):</p>
  <p class="quote">Murder your darlings.</p>

  <p>On bells and whistles: symbolism is there to enrich/adorn, not “create a sense of artificial profundity.”</p>
  <p>When you finish writing, take a step back and ask why it matters. Writing is like scanning and identifying trees. After writing, you must step back and look at the forest, the theme, the point.</p>
